# REFLECTIONS

## Why I chose React
I picked React because I’ve seen React used a lot in real projects. Additionally, the tooling makes it easy to make a single page app quickly.

## Difficulties I ran into
At first my component only rendered part of the string (“Hello,”) and not the full dynamic value. This ended up being because I wasn’t actually using the prop I passed in, and also because the dev server was caching an older version of the file.

## Something entertaining
The dodgers won the world series. I don't really care but my family does so I guess that's entertaining.
